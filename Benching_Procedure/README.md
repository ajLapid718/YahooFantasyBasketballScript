**Reminder**: The time the script will take to complete can vary. The timer starts the moment the first prompt appears. Expect the duration to range from a little over two minutes to a little under four minutes. Another thing that might seem problematic is receiving an error message. For the most part, there should be no worries about these. The program should proceed as expected afterwards.
