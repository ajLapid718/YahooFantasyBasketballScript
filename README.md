When I figure out what's going on, you'll know what's going on.

I have some basic functionality going on.
There's a lot of improvements that can be done.
But I'm pretty happy with what I've done so far.

I'll try to work on this for the week.
Looking to get a range/loop going to handle the repetitive logic at the bottom.
Going to need to get user input.
Going to need to make sure the password gets typed as a hidden text in the terminal.

Going to see how far I can take this in a week.
This was the MVP so anything from here is a major plus to me.
