##### To Do List
- [ ] Clean up the formatting (spacing and tabbing) for better readability and organization
- [ ] Define functions in order to consolidate the separate parts of the script
- [x] In the event of 11, 12, or 13 players having a game on the same day (or active position slots are fully occupied) report which players are on the bench
- [ ] Update the annotated version of the script to become up to date
- [ ] Add more information to this README file
- [ ] Improve exception handling especially regarding the logging in

##### Possible Functionality to Implement (Potential Extras)
- [ ] Account for the Injury List (IL) position for a more accurate head count
- [x] Include a bench-all-players procedure as a separate script to account for the case when a user can guarantee a win (preserving percentages or turnovers) by doing so...which typically happens on a Sunday
- [ ] Get user input to process decisions about substitutions in the event that 11, 12, or 13 players have a game on the same day
- [ ] Relay the names of players in Free Agency who belong to the top 10 performers of a specified category
- [ ] Convert the script file into a portable executable file
